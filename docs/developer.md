# Developer Guide

## Get Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development mode: `npm start`
4. Build for production: `npm run compile`

## Architecture

Launchpad is built using modern web technologies with security-first principles:

- **Electron**: Secure desktop application framework with latest security patches
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the codebase
- **Modular Design**: Monorepo architecture with independent packages

### Security

- Built following Electron security [best practices](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security)
- Context isolation and secure preload scripts
- No Node.js APIs exposed to renderer processes
- Code signing support for distribution

## Project Structure

The project is designed as monorepo where each part of the application is an independent package.
Each package could have own tech stack, tests, dependencies, frameworks, etc.
All internal names are prefixed by `@app/*`.
There are no technical reasons for this.
It's just for you to make it easier to understand the architecture.

Initially, the repository contains only a few packages.

### Packages with building tools:

It is used in `npm run init` to configure a new interface package.

- [`packages/electron-versions`](packages/electron-versions) - A set of helper functions to get the versions of internal components bundled within Electron.

### Packages with app logic:

- [`packages/main`](packages/main) - Implementation of Electron's [**main script**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file).
- [`packages/preload`](packages/preload) - Implementation of Electron's [**preload scripts**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-preload).

### Renderer Package

The [`packages/renderer`](packages/renderer) package contains the React-based user interface for the Launchpad application. It provides the main interface for launching and managing Greenroom products.

- Built with React and TypeScript
- Styled with modern CSS
- Integrated with the main Electron process via secure preload scripts

## Distribution

### Building Executables

Launchpad uses [electron-builder] to create distributable applications:

- **Development builds**: `npm run compile` - Creates local executable without auto-update
- **Production builds**: Automated via GitHub Actions for official releases
- **Debug builds**: `npm run compile -- --dir -c.asar=false` - Unpackaged for debugging

Built applications can check for and install updates when distributed through official channels. Checks are opt-in and off by default; see [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

### Creating Releases

Official releases are created using a tag-based workflow. See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) for detailed instructions on:

- Creating version tags
- Automated build and release process
- Publishing releases
- Troubleshooting release issues

### Working with third-party dependencies

Because the `renderer` works and builds like a _regular web application_, you can only use dependencies that support the
browser or compile to a browser-friendly format.

This means that in the `renderer` you are free to use any frontend dependencies such as Vue, React, lodash, axios and so
on. However, you _CANNOT_ use any native Node.js APIs, such as, `systeminformation`. These APIs are _only_ available in
a Node.js runtime environment and will cause your application to crash if used in the `renderer` layer. Instead, if you
need access to Node.js runtime APIs in your frontend, export a function form the `preload` package.

All dependencies that require Node.js api can be used in
the [`preload` script](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/process-model#preload-scripts).

#### Expose in the main world

Here is an example. Let's say you need to read some data from the file system or database in the renderer.

In the preload context, create a function that reads and returns data. To make the function announced in the preload
available in the render, you usually need to call
the [`electron.contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld`](https://www.electronjs.org/ru/docs/latest/api/context-bridge).

However, this template is designed to use all power of ES modules.
You can import anything from `preload` in `renderer`.
All the data will quietly throw through the `electron.contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld()`,
so you don't need to worry about it.

```ts
// preload/src/index.ts
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

// Encapsulate types if you use typescript
interface UserData {
  prop: string;
}

// Will call `electron.contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('getUserData', getUserData)`
export function getUserData(): Promise<UserData> {
  return readFile('/path/to/file/in/user/filesystem.json', { encoding: 'utf8' }).then(JSON.parse);
}
```

Now you can import and call the method in renderer

```ts
// renderer/src/anywhere/component.ts
import { getUserData } from '@app/preload';

// Method will came from exposed context
// const userData = globalThis['getUserData']
const userData = await getUserData();
```

### Working with Electron API

Although the preload has access to all of Node.js API, it **still runs in the BrowserWindow context**, so only limited
electron modules are available in it.

> [!TIP]
> Check the [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/ru/docs/latest/api/clipboard) for the full list of available
> methods.

All other electron methods can be invoked in the `main`.

As a result, the architecture of interaction between all modules is as follows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
renderer->>+preload: Read data from file system
preload->>-renderer: Data
renderer->>preload: Maximize window
activate preload
preload-->>main: Invoke IPC command
activate main
main-->>preload: IPC response
deactivate main
preload->>renderer: Window maximized
deactivate preload
```

### Modes and Environment Variables

All environment variables are set as part of the `import.meta`, so you can access them vie the following
way: `import.meta.env`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using TypeScript and want to get code completion,
> you must add all the environment variables to the [`ImportMetaEnv` in `types/env.d.ts`](types/env.d.ts).

The mode option is used to specify the value of `import.meta.env.MODE` and the corresponding environment variables files
that need to be loaded.

By default, there are two modes:

- `production` is used by default
- `development` is used by `npm start` script

When running the build script, the environment variables are loaded from the following files in your project root:

```
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified env mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified env mode, ignored by git
```

> [!WARNING]
> To prevent accidentally leaking env variables to the client, only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to your
> Vite-processed code.

For example, let's take the following `.env` file:

```
DB_PASSWORD=foobar
VITE_SOME_KEY=123
```

Only `VITE_SOME_KEY` will be exposed as `import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY` to your client source code, but `DB_PASSWORD`
will not.

> [!TIP]
> You can change that prefix or add another. See [`envPrefix`](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#envprefix).

### NPM Scripts

```sh
npm start
```

Start application in development more with hot-reload.

---

```sh
npm run build
```

Runs the `build` command in all workspaces if present.

---

```sh
npm run compile
```

First runs the `build` script,
then compiles the project into executable using `electron-builder` with the specified configuration.

---

```sh
npm run compile -- --dir -c.asar=false
```

Same as `npm run compile` but passes additional parameters to disable archive packaging and installer creation.
Useful for debugging the compiled application.

---

```sh
npm run test
```

Executes end-to-end tests on **compiled app** using Playwright.

---

```sh
npm run typecheck
```

Runs the `typecheck` command in all workspaces if present.

---

## Development

This project uses a monorepo structure with independent packages. Each package can have its own dependencies, tests, and build processes. See the individual package README files for specific development instructions.
